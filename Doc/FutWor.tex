\section{Future work}
\subsection{Displaying the electronic density}
The idea is to create a grid around the molecule with the value of the electronic density. This can then be represented by an isosurface. Each electronic state has its own density, and by propagating the coefficients in equation \ref{boexp} we "populate different electronic states", basically reshaping the overall density.

\section{Questions}
\td{which units is $\hbar$}
\td{rassi energies or rasscf energies?}
